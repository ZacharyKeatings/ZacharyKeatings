### [Pykemon](https://github.com/ZacharyKeatings/Pykemon)
A personal project where I use **Python** and **PyGame** to recreate the classic first-generation Pokémon games. This project is an ongoing endeavor to revive nostalgic experiences with modern coding techniques.

### [Citadel of Whispers](https://github.com/ZacharyKeatings/Citadel-of-Whispers)
A tile-based roguelike inspired by Rick Saada's "Castle of the Winds", written in **C#**.
